The main body of the program follows. The algorithm proceeds in the following stages:

(0) Prep work. Generate objects used throughout such as objects for storing output.

(1) Compute stationary equilibria for the initial state (pre-referendum) and each of the long-run post-Brexit states.

(2) Compute transition paths.

(3) Compute various statistics, plot results, save results

#*************(0) Prep work**********************

#=
#Set up storage for stationary equilibria and transition paths

#SE - array of stationary equilibria (one for each element of par_diff).

#TP -transition paths
 This is a matrix of stationary equilibria struct. Calling it a stationary equilibrium is not accurate but it is essentially a path of distribution, value functions, etc. over time, where in each period we store the same objects that would be stored in a stationary equilibrium.

#It is assumed that:
1) the number of grid points etc. are the same for all parametrisations, values from par[1] are used.
2) the length of all transition paths is the same and equal to the value in par[1].T_max)

To do:
- Find closest two gridpoints and the weights. Split this into two functions - because the closest gridpoints can be precomputed (they are always the same becuase we are starting on a grid and the choice is either h(z) or (1-Î´k).

- Iterate on a SE candidate using the policy function, to get a limiting distribution of firms, given prices.
- change function ED - is it actually necessary to create a copy of SEg? It doesn't seem to be an issue that it is overwritten.

- in the firm problem solution (maximising value) check why there is sometimes slightly negative adjustment threshold (numerical inaccuracy or grid boundary?)

- simulation - two options: manual, or construct a transition matrix, and use BLAS matrix multiplication (multithreaded, optimised). Which is faster? It might depend also on the number of iterations...

- check the stopping criterion in value function iteration - this will be important once we iterate over prices so the firm's problem is solved many times (for now it doesn't matter that 500 iterations are performed)
