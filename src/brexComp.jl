#brexComp.jl contains functions for computing stationary equilibrium and transition paths.

#Function SE_compute! computes stationary equilibrium for given parameters par. SE is the initial guess for stationary equilibrium and the function changes it (hence the ! in name)
function SE_compute!(par,SE)
#=Computation of stationary equilibrium proceeds in the following steps

(1) Given prices, solve the firm's problem
(2) Given solution of the firm's problem, find a stationary distirbution
(3) Check the market clearing conditions and update prices
Steps (1) - (3) are repeated until convergence in prices
