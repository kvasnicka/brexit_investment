#brexComp.jl contains functions for computing stationary equilibrium and transition paths.

#Function SE_compute! computes stationary equilibrium for given parameters par. SE is the initial guess for stationary equilibrium and the function changes it (hence the ! in name)
function SE_compute!(par,SE)

#Computation of stationary equilibrium proceeds in the following steps

#Actually it should be changed - the initial guess can be one of the other equilibria - policy functions should not be too different.

#Solve firm's problem for given prices.

    return SE
